# Vite Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## 1.0.31 - 2023.06.07
### Added

* Added the `create-release` GitHub workflow to automate release tagging

## 1.0.30 - 2023.01.25
### Changed
* Updated the `craft.vite.asset()` function to work with Vite 3.x or later, where assets are stored as top-level entries in the `manifest.json` ([#56](https://github.com/nystudio107/craft-vite/issues/56)) ([#31](https://github.com/nystudio107/craft-vite/issues/31))
* You can now include CSS manually if it's a top-level entry in your `vite.config.js` (rather than being imported into your JavaScript) via `craft.vite.asset("src/css/app.css")` ([#31](https://github.com/nystudio107/craft-vite/issues/31))

## 1.0.29 - 2023.01.01
### Changed
* Move to using `ServicesTrait` and add getter methods for services
* Update the docs to use Vitepress `^1.0.0-alpha.29`

### Fixed
* Fixed an issue where `craft.vite.includeCriticalCssTags()` would fail if you had `template` in the file path ([#45](https://github.com/nystudio107/craft-vite/issues/45))

## 1.0.28 - 2022.09.09
### Added
* Added support for detecting dev-mode in Craft CMS v4 by changing `App::env('ENVIRONMENT') === 'dev'`

### Fixed
* Set the `ViteService` config in the constructor, so that settings from the `config/vite.php` are pre-populated before the `ViteService::init()` method is called ([#44](https://github.com/nystudio107/craft-vite/issues/44))

## 1.0.27 - 2022.07.16
### Changed

## 1.0.26 - 2022.06.29
### Changed
* Adds a boolean as a second param to the `craft.vite.asset(url, true)` so that assets in the vite public folder can be referenced correctly from Twig ([#10](https://github.com/nystudio107/craft-plugin-vite/pull/10))

## 1.0.25 - 2022.05.15
### Fixed

## 1.0.21 - 2022.01.17
